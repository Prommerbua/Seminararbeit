  abstract = {We present a method for generating surface crack patterns that appear in materials such as mud, ceramic glaze, and glass. To model these phenomena, we build upon existing physically based methods. Our algorithm generates cracks from a stress field defined heuristically over a triangle discretization of the surface. The simulation produces cracks by evolving this field over time. The user can control the characteristics and appearance of the cracks using a set of simple parameters. By changing these parameters, we have generated examples similar to a variety of crack patterns found in the real world. We assess the realism of our results by comparison with photographs of real-world examples. Using a physically based approach also enables us to generate animations similar to time-lapse photography.}

  abstract  = {The application of spring-mass systems to the animation of brittle fracture is revisited. The motivation arises from the recent popularity of peridynamics in the computational physics community. Peridynamic systems can be regarded as spring-mass systems with two specific properties. First, spring forces are based on a simple strain metric, thereby decoupling spring stiffness from spring length. Second, masses are connected using a distance-based criterion. The relatively large radius of influence typically leads to a few hundred springs for every mass point. Spring-mass systems with these properties are shown to be simple to implement, trivially parallelized, and well-suited to animating brittle fracture.},

  abstract  = {This paper describes a simulation system that has been developed to model the deformation and fracture of solid objects in a real-time gaming context. Based around a corotational tetrahedral finite element method, this system has been constructed from components published in the graphics and computational physics literatures. The goal of this paper is to describe how these components can be combined to produce an engine that is robust to unpredictable user interactions, fast enough to model reasonable scenarios at real-time speeds, suitable for use in the design of a game level, and with appropriate controls allowing content creators to match artistic direction. Details concerning parallel implementation, solver design, rendering method, and other aspects of the simulation are elucidated with the intent of providing a guide to others wishing to implement similar systems. Examples from in-game scenes captured on the Xbox 360, PS3, and PC platforms are included.},
